# Top Java Compiler Error Messages

## What is this?

This is the list of the **top 20** Java "first"[^1] compiler error messages made by students from [Blackbox Mini][]. The Java files in this repo are minimal(-ish) Java files
that will produce the corresponding error message in most versions of the OpenJDK `javac` compiler. This list does not include runtime errors (so `NullPointerException`
is not on this list, sorry!).

Because error message distributions [tend to follow the Zipf-Mandelbrot law][pritchard], these 20 error messages account for 85.72% of all error messages in
the entire Blackbox Mini dataset.

[^1]: A "first" compiler error message is the first error message reported when multiple error messages are reported. This is because the first error message reported is
typically a true indication of a real error that occurred, whereas, any subsequent error message might be a false positive, due to faulty error recovery in the reporting
the first error message.

### Explanation

The list is ordered from most frequently occurring to least frequently occurring. <kbd>name</kbd> indicates a placeholder where a name (e.g., variable, class, type,
method, package) would go.

#### Columns

 - **Raw Frequency**: the total count that error messages of that category have appeared in the entire Blackbox Mini dataset
 - **Origin**: What stage of compilation does this error message originate from? For the purposes of this file, a Java file first passes through the scanner, then the
   parser. Once a full internal representation of the code and all its symbols (e.g., variable names) is created, they are the symbols are then resolved (linked to
   a concrete definition). Finally, the code is analyzed in various ways, including checking types and ensuring that all code paths have a valid return statement (Flow
   Analysis).
 - **Percentage**: the percentage of _all_ (not just the top 20) first error message that this category represents.
 - **Cumulative Percentage**: the percentage of _all_ error messages this category represents, plus the percentage of all categories before it.
